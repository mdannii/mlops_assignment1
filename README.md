# Machine Learning Model Training and Testing

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline using Python. It includes data loading, model training, evaluation, and testing using a linear regression model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Training Script

To train the model and evaluate its performance, run the following command:

```sh
python model/train.py
```

This will load the dataset, train a linear regression model, and print the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the model on the test set.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
pytest model/test_model.py
```

This will execute the test cases defined in the [`model/test_model.py`](model/test_model.py) file.

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline is defined in the [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) file. It includes steps for linting the code with `flake8` and running tests with `pytest`.

## Dataset

The dataset is located in the [`data/dataset.csv`](data/dataset.csv) file. It contains three columns: `feature1`, `feature2`, and `target`.
